Leaderboard List App Project
This is a JavaScript project for a Leaderboard list app, which uses modern web development tools and techniques such as webpack and ES6 modules.

The primary goal of this project is to build a functional app that displays a leaderboard list, following a given wireframe. The focus is on implementing the app's functionality, without any styling at first.

In subsequent activities, the app will be enhanced to consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript's async and await functionality. Additional styling will also be added to improve the app's user interface.

Technologies Used
JavaScript
Webpack
ES6 features (notably modules)
HTML and CSS for markup and styling
How to Run the App
Clone the repository to your local machine
Install the required dependencies by running npm install
